A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers



Web server in its hardware form stores the html, java, css, image,
        it also stores web server software. The web server software controls
        how websites are accessed. This is done with the help of HTTP server,
        that understand URL and HTTP requests, to deliver us a static webpage.
        5. Application Server handles the business logic. This means it will
        transform the data to provide special functions, to make the webpage
        interactive with the user. It is an intermediate between the webserver
        and database. It reduces the complex interaction between webserver and
        database, by storing previous interactions, giving better performance,
        better management.


 Database is a way to store information in an organized manner so
        that it can be easily accessed, updated and utilized.
        6. The server uses IP address to communicate with the client using
        protocols like TCP\IP, HTTP.
